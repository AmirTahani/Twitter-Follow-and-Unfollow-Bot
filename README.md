This is a twitter bot that allows you to do a few things:


1. Follow back users that follow you.
2. Follow the followers of another user. 
3. Follow users based on a keyword. 
4. Follow users who retweeted a tweet.
5. Unfollow users that don't follow you back. 
6. Unfollow all users. 
7. Send users automated DMs.
8. Get follower and following count. 
9. Quit


You will need tweepy, re and time installed.

FOR WHITELISTING:

Whitelisting a user means that the bot will NOT unfollow them. To whitelist a user, input one screen_name WITHOUT the @ sign per line below. Here are some examples. Input the names to the whitelisted.txt file.
